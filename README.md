# Features 
- Upload raw meteorological datasets (e.g., NASA POWER CSVs)  
- Map input columns to DNDC-required fields (Jday, MaxT, MinT, Prec, WindSpeed, Humidity)  
- Validate formats, units, and missing values  
- Convert data into DNDC-compatible climate input files  
- Visualize daily and seasonal trends of meteorological variables  
- Download processed DNDC-ready files

Try uploading a raw climate CSV to see it converted into a DNDC-ready file

# Research Context 
Accurate climate inputs are essential for running the **DNDC (Denitrification-Decomposition) model**, which simulates soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics. This pipeline enables reproducible, standardized preprocessing for research on **atmosphereâ€“soil interactions and air quality impacts**.  

# Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Frameworks**: Streamlit  
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy
